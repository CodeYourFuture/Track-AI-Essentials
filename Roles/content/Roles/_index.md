## Roles Project

### Why are we doing this?

As you explore the Google AI Essentials course, you will apply what you are learning to this project. In **Roles** you will act as different people participating in the hiring process. Each role has its own perspective through which you are seeing the same information. You'll come to understand:

- why recruiters only spend six seconds reading a CV
- why interviewers don't always pick the "best coder"
- what drives the use of AI to filter out your application before a human ever sees it
- why your cover letter reads just like everyone else's

...And many other things besides. You must take on all 4 roles during your three weeks of this course. So you will need to find efficiencies to get through the work.

### Starting role

For this project to work, you can't all do the same role at the same time. Therefore, we will assign based on quarters of the year. If your birthday is Q1, start with Recruiter on sprint 1.

| Birthday Quarter | Role in Sprint 1 | Roles in Sprint 2         | Roles in Sprint 3      |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Jan, Feb, Mar    | Recruiter        | Hiring Manager            | Interviewer, Candidate |
| Apr, May, Jun    | Hiring Manager   | Interviewer               | Candidate, Recruiter   |
| Jul, Aug, Sep    | Interviewer      | Candidate, Recruiter      | Hiring Manager         |
| Oct, Nov, Dec    | Candidate        | Recruiter, Hiring Manager | Interviewer            |

### How to get help

There isn't a mentor to lead your team: all trainees must work together to complete the project. How will you share the work so you can get it all done? What tips can you share with each other? How can teamwork, including robot friends, help?

### How to submit

You must produce at least one artefact per role. The documents are described in the role assignments.
