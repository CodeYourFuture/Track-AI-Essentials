1. Finding a job you can do well in
2. Finding a way to get your application noticed!

How do other job seekers do this? Well, they use all kinds of different systems. But what will you do?

## üìã The Format

### What You'll Get

- You'll get a job description
- If you contact the hiring manager, you might also get extra information about the role

### What You'll Make

- A persuasive cover letter that helps you stand out

## üß™ Activities

## üìù Reflection Questions

After your interview, consider and write down in your notebook:

3. What will you do differently next time?
4. If you used AI to prepare, did it help?
