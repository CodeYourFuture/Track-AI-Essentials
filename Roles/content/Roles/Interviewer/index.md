In this role, you're going to act as an interviewer. In your team, someone has just left for a new job. You really need a new team member because you are all delivering a huge project. It's really stressful! But your team had a bad experience last year with a colleague who wouldn't work with others, so you _also_ want to make sure this person will not upset your friendly, productive working environment. It's a challenge. You know you can't find this out for sure in a twenty minute conversation, but that's almost _all_ you have to go on. How will you evaluate interviewees quickly, efficiently and fairly, whilst:

1. Finding someone who can do the work you need
2. Finding someone who can work with the people on your team

How do interviewers do this? Well, they use all kinds of different systems. But what will you do?

## üìã The Format

### What You'll Get

- You'll get this [job description](jobs/#finsoft-xl-solutions), that the candidate has seen.
- You'll get each candidate's application: CV and cover letter
- You'll also get a team description, that only you know.

### What You'll Make

- An interview plan
- A way to score the candidates
- A job offer
- If you are asked, feedback for unsuccessful candidates

## ‚úÖ Worked Example: Software Developer Interview

<details><summary>

#### Sample Team Story (the part we don't tell the candidate)

</summary>

Our team has one senior developer part time, and two very junior developers on it. Last year we had two mid level developers, a UX designer and a Scrum master. But the UX people were all laid off and the Scrum master is on Maternity leave and hasn't been covered.

Our two mid level developers fell out with each other because one, a React expert, started unilaterally rewriting features in React and didn't document or explain their changes. It caused a fight. They have now _both_ left in a huff, we are trying to deliver a whole new transactions front end for our main client and half our codebase is now React, which we don't really know yet!

It's been a dreadful mess, but the good news is our little team is now really working well
together. We have reflected and learned from our mistakes and now we all review each other's code before we merge it. We also now have headcount to hire either two more junior developers or one senior.

We really just want friendly colleagues who know how to do proper code review. They don't need to be React experts, they just need to be willing to learn and explain what they have learned to the team.

## üß™ Activities

{{<note type="activity" title="1 - Planning">}}
Review the [provided job description](jobs/#finsoft-xl-solutions), backstory, and candidates and create your interview questions:

- What are the must-have criteria that you need to find out?
- What are the nice-to-have criteria that you can be flexible about?
- How will you score each element?
- Will you ask the same questions each time or different questions based on their application?
- You only have one hour to interview people. Will you interview 4 people for 15 minutes each? 4 people together for an hour? Will you team up with other interviewers? Can AI help?

{{</note>}}

{{<note type="activity" title="2. Interviewing">}}

You need some classmates to act as candidates to complete your project. (You will also need to take on the role of candidate to complete the whole Roles project.) You can do this in class after the workshop or arrange it during the week.

- Open a Google Meet or sit down with your candidate
- Conduct your interviews.
- Score your candidates.
- Hire one!

## üìù Reflection Questions

After each interview, consider:

1. What patterns do you notice in strong candidates?
2. Which criteria were most helpful in making decisions?
3. How will you handle borderline cases?
4. What would make your interviews more efficient, fair, or reliable?
5. If you used AI, did it help?

## Submitting Your Work

There's no submission step. Your work is complete when you have "hired" a candidate. Write down your reflections in your notebook.
