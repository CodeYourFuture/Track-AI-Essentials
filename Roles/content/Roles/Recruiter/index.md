In this role, you're going to act as a recruiter. You have just a few hours to find the best 8 candidates to put forward for 1 job. You have piles and piles of possible candidates, so you cannot read them all. But as a recruiter you make your money when a candidate _you find_ is offered the job. How will you evaluate candidates quickly, efficiently and fairly, whilst:

1. Finding strong candidates the hiring manager wants to interview?
1. Finding the candidate the interviewer wants to hire!

How do recruiters do this? Well, they use all kinds of technology, professional experience, and existing APIs. But what will you do?

Before you start, review just 5 candidates and do the following evaluations:

1. Rank the profiles from best to worst.
2. Analyse your ranking: what are the key differentiators between the bottom and the top?
3. Test your decision: can you spot any red flags or missing information that affected your choices? Could you add this to your checklist?
