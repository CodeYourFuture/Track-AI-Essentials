In this role, you're going to act as a hiring manager. You support several teams and they all desperately need new workers to help. Each team has different needs, and you have just a few hours to find the best 4 candidates to interview for each job. You definitely cannot interview hundreds of people. As a hiring manager, you are successful when the candidates you put forward are not just hired, but bring value to the teams they join. How will you evaluate candidates quickly, efficiently and fairly, whilst:

1. Recommending good candidates that the interviewer wants to hire.
2. Recommending people who do their new job well.

There's another thing hiring managers worry about a lot. Sometimes even more than someone who does well, they want to make sure they don't hire anybody who does badly. This usually means someone who can't work with the other people, as this actually brings down the performance of the whole team. How do hiring managers do this? Well, they use all kinds of technology, professional experience, and existing APIs. But what will you do?

## üìã The Format

2. Analyse your ranking: what are the key differentiators between the bottom and the top?
3. Test your decision: can you spot any red flags or missing information that affected your choices? Could you add this to your checklist?

4. What would make your screening more efficient?
5. If you used AI, did it help?
