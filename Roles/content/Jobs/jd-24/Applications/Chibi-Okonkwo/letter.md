Hiring Manager  
Ping DataCenter Operations  
Reading

## Re: Infrastructure Support Technician Position

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the Infrastructure Support Technician position at Ping DataCenter Operations. With my extensive background in security systems infrastructure and team supervision, I believe I can bring valuable experience to your datacenter team.

My role as Security Supervisor at Securitas UK involved managing critical technical infrastructure that shares many parallels with datacenter operations:

- **24/7 Critical Systems**: Maintaining security systems that required continuous operation with minimal downtime
- **Infrastructure Management**: Installing, configuring, and maintaining integrated hardware systems
- **Network Operations**: Managing interconnected security devices across complex network infrastructure
- **Technical Documentation**: Creating comprehensive documentation for system configurations and procedures
- **Team Coordination**: Supervising technical staff across multiple shifts in a round-the-clock operation

While security systems differ from datacenter infrastructure in their specific applications, the fundamental principles of reliable system management, monitoring, and maintenance are directly transferable. My experience maintaining critical systems where failures could have significant consequences has instilled a disciplined approach to infrastructure management that would be valuable in a datacenter environment.

My current training with CodeYourFuture has built upon this foundation with more specific technical knowledge in areas such as:

- Linux system administration
- Network configuration and troubleshooting
- Infrastructure automation and monitoring
- Cloud platform fundamentals and infrastructure as code

I am comfortable with the physical aspects of datacenter work, including equipment lifting and installation, having regularly handled similar tasks in my security role. The shift-based schedule is familiar to me from my security background, where I managed 24/7 operations and understood the importance of consistent coverage for critical systems.

While I am currently based in London, I am willing to relocate to Reading for this opportunity. The professional development benefits, particularly datacenter certifications, are especially attractive as they align perfectly with my career development goals in infrastructure management.

What particularly draws me to Ping DataCenter Operations is the opportunity to apply my infrastructure experience in an environment where technical excellence and reliability are paramount. I am eager to expand my skillset in datacenter operations while bringing my existing knowledge of critical system management to your team.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background and technical skills could benefit your datacenter operations.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Chibi Okonkwo
