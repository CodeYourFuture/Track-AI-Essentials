Hiring Manager  
Ping DataCenter Operations  
Reading

## Re: Infrastructure Support Technician Position

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the Infrastructure Support Technician position at Ping DataCenter Operations. As a Reading resident with a passion for infrastructure management and practical experience through my home lab environment, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your datacenter team.

While I am early in my professional IT career, I have developed substantial hands-on skills through my extensive home lab projects and formal IT training that align directly with the requirements of this role:

- **Server Management**: Experience configuring and maintaining multiple physical servers running Windows Server and Linux distributions
- **Networking**: Practical knowledge of routing, switching, VLANs, and network troubleshooting
- **Infrastructure**: Hands-on experience with rack mounting, cable management, and physical server installation
- **Virtualization**: Implementation of Proxmox and VMware environments hosting multiple virtual machines
- **Documentation**: Creation of comprehensive technical procedures and network diagrams
- **Monitoring**: System performance tracking and resource utilization monitoring

My home lab environment has given me practical experience with many aspects of datacenter operations on a smaller scale. I've deliberately designed my projects to mirror professional practices, implementing proper cable management, documentation standards, and backup procedures. Through simulated failure scenarios, I've developed systematic troubleshooting approaches and recovery strategies‚Äîskills directly applicable to the 24/7 support environment at Ping.

What particularly attracts me to this position is the hands-on nature of the role and the opportunity to work with critical infrastructure at scale. I am eager to apply my technical knowledge in a professional datacenter environment where I can continue to develop my skills while contributing to the reliability of essential systems.

I am comfortable with the physical aspects of datacenter work, including lifting equipment and the precise handling required for server installations. The shift-based schedule aligns well with my flexibility and commitment to providing consistent support for critical systems.

Living locally in Reading means I can respond quickly when needed, and the benefit of datacenter certifications would support my continued professional development in infrastructure management.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my technical skills and enthusiasm for infrastructure management could benefit your team. I am available for an interview at your convenience.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Ben Walker
