Hiring Manager  
Ping DataCenter Operations  
Reading

## Re: Infrastructure Support Technician Position

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the Infrastructure Support Technician position at Ping DataCenter Operations. With my extensive background in network administration and infrastructure management, I believe I can make a valuable contribution to your datacenter team.

During my five years as a Network Administrator at Kyivstar, Ukraine's largest telecommunications company, I was responsible for maintaining critical network infrastructure that directly parallels many aspects of datacenter operations:

- **24/7 Critical Infrastructure**: Managing systems that required continuous operation with minimal downtime
- **Hardware Installation**: Implementing and maintaining physical network equipment and servers
- **Cable Management**: Designing and maintaining structured cabling systems for network reliability
- **Monitoring Systems**: Implementing comprehensive monitoring for early issue detection
- **Documentation**: Creating detailed technical procedures and network architecture diagrams
- **Team Coordination**: Supervising technical staff across shifts in a continuous operation

The telecommunications environment shares many challenges with datacenter operations, including the need for redundancy, careful change management, and rapid response to critical issues. My experience participating in a 24/7 on-call rotation has prepared me for the shift-based schedule required in datacenter operations, and I understand the importance of clear handover procedures and documentation for continuous operations.

My current training with CodeYourFuture has enhanced my technical knowledge in areas specifically relevant to datacenter infrastructure:

- Infrastructure automation using Python and Terraform
- Monitoring implementation with Prometheus and Grafana
- Cloud resource management with AWS
- Advanced Linux system administration

I am comfortable with the physical aspects of datacenter work, having regularly handled equipment installation, cable management, and hardware troubleshooting in my previous roles. While I am currently based in London, I am willing to relocate to Reading for this opportunity, and the shift-based schedule is familiar to me from my telecommunications background.

What particularly attracts me to Ping DataCenter Operations is the opportunity to apply my infrastructure experience in an environment focused specifically on datacenter excellence. The professional development benefits, especially datacenter certifications, align perfectly with my career goals in infrastructure management.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience and technical skills could benefit your datacenter operations. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Iryna Kovalenko
