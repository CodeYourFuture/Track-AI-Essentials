# Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

The Database Administrator position at DataVault Systems caught my attention as it combines my extensive experience in information governance with my growing expertise in database management.

In my current role at Manchester NHS Trust, I manage secure database access for over 200 healthcare professionals while ensuring strict compliance with data protection regulations. This experience has given me a deep understanding of database security principles and user permission management, key requirements for your position.

The technical aspects of this role align well with my recent focus on database administration and SQL. My background in healthcare records management has taught me the critical importance of maintaining data integrity and implementing robust backup procedures, skills that would transfer effectively to managing your enterprise-level database solutions.

The opportunity to expand my technical capabilities through your comprehensive training programme would be invaluable. I am eager to contribute my unique perspective on data protection and security to your team while developing advanced database administration skills.

Kind regards,
Anna Petrova
