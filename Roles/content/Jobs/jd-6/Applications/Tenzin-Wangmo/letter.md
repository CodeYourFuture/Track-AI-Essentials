# Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

The Database Administrator position at DataVault Systems perfectly aligns with my background in operational systems management and my current focus on database administration through CodeYourFuture's engineering programme.

Your requirement for strong analytical skills and database optimization experience matches my track record of implementing efficient database solutions. At Himalayan Kitchen, I developed a custom inventory management system that reduced waste by 30% while maintaining data integrity across multiple connected systems.

The technical requirements of this role complement my current work at CodeYourFuture, where I've gained hands-on experience with PostgreSQL optimization and automated backup procedures. My experience managing complex operational systems has given me a unique perspective on database administration, particularly in maintaining system reliability while optimizing performance.

DataVault Systems' emphasis on professional development through your training budget resonates with my commitment to continuous learning. Having already obtained my AWS Cloud Practitioner certification, I am eager to expand my database administration expertise while contributing to your team's success.

Kind regards,
Tenzin Wangmo
