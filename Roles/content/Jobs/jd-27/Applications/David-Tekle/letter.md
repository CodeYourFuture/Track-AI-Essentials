## Re: IT Support Technician Position

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the IT Support Technician position at St. Margaret's Academy. With my background in education technology and digital accessibility, I am excited about the opportunity to support the technology needs of your students and staff.

Having worked as a Community Learning Coordinator at Leeds Digital Skills Initiative, I've developed a deep understanding of how technology can enhance the educational experience when properly supported. I've gained practical experience in areas directly relevant to your requirements:

- **Classroom Technology Support**: Maintained and troubleshot computers, tablets, and AV equipment across multiple community learning centers, developing quick problem-solving skills while minimizing disruption to learning.

- **iPad Management**: Configured, deployed, and supported tablet devices for educational purposes, including app management, updates, and user support‚Äîskills that would directly benefit your 1:1 iPad program.

- **Interactive Whiteboard Support**: Set up and maintained interactive displays, providing training and troubleshooting for instructors to ensure effective classroom use.

- **Event Setup**: Configured audio-visual equipment for presentations and community events, ensuring reliable operation during critical moments.

- **User Assistance**: Provided patient, clear technical support to users with varying levels of technical proficiency, adapting my communication style to make technology accessible to everyone.

My computer science degree has given me a solid technical foundation, while my experience creating accessible educational software has taught me the importance of making technology work for all users. I'm particularly passionate about helping students access educational resources regardless of their technical background or abilities.

As a Leeds resident, I'm familiar with the excellent reputation of St. Margaret's Academy, and I would be proud to contribute to your educational mission. I appreciate that the role is term-time only, which allows for a healthy work-life balance while focusing intensively on supporting the school during the academic year.

I am committed to ongoing professional development and would be eager to expand my knowledge of educational technologies specific to your environment, such as furthering my expertise with Google Workspace and Microsoft 365.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my technical skills and educational experience could support the technology needs of St. Margaret's Academy. I am available for an interview at your convenience and can provide an enhanced DBS check.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

David Tekle
