## Re: IT Support Technician Position

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the IT Support Technician position at St. Margaret's Academy. Currently based in Birmingham, I am willing to relocate to Leeds for this opportunity to combine my technical interests with my passion for education and supporting others.

While my background in warehouse management may seem different from educational IT support, the core skills I've developed are directly transferable:

- **Asset Management**: As a Warehouse Team Leader, I maintained detailed tracking systems for thousands of inventory items‚Äîskills that would transfer well to managing school technology assets and inventory.

- **Technical Troubleshooting**: I regularly resolved issues with inventory management systems and handheld devices, developing a methodical approach to problem-solving that applies to any technical environment.

- **Team Support**: I trained and supported staff with varying levels of technical comfort, adapting my communication style to ensure everyone could use our systems effectively‚Äîan approach that would serve me well when supporting teachers and students.

- **Reliability**: I maintained a perfect attendance record over three years in my previous role, demonstrating the dependability that's essential in a school environment where technical issues need prompt attention.

- **Organization**: I implemented structured processes that improved efficiency by 25%, showing my ability to create order in complex operational environments.

My current training with CodeYourFuture has supplemented these transferable skills with technical knowledge including basic hardware troubleshooting, networking fundamentals, and IT support best practices. I've particularly enjoyed the opportunities to help fellow students resolve technical issues during our sessions.

I'm especially interested in the asset tracking and inventory aspects of this role, as my experience has shown me the importance of maintaining accurate records for equipment maintenance and replacement planning. I would bring strong organizational systems to help maintain your IT suites and 1:1 iPad program.

The educational environment appeals to me because I value the opportunity to make a positive difference through my work. Helping teachers use technology effectively and ensuring students have reliable access to learning tools would be deeply satisfying.

I understand the role requires an enhanced DBS check, which I would be happy to complete. While I don't have direct experience in education, I have volunteered with youth community programs and am comfortable working with young people in a respectful, appropriate manner.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my unique background and skills could benefit St. Margaret's Academy. I am available for an interview at your convenience and am prepared to relocate to Leeds if selected for the position.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Jean Claude Mugisha
