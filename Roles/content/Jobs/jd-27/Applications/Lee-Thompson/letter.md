## Re: IT Support Technician Position

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the IT Support Technician position at St. Margaret's Academy. As a Leeds resident with a background in practical problem-solving and project management, I am excited about the opportunity to support the technology needs of your students and staff.

While my professional experience comes from the construction industry rather than education, I've found that many skills transfer effectively between these environments:

- **Technical Troubleshooting**: Construction sites and classrooms both present daily technical challenges that require quick, creative solutions with minimal disruption.

- **Equipment Setup and Maintenance**: Whether setting up a worksite or preparing for a school assembly, the principles of equipment management, testing, and troubleshooting remain constant.

- **Clear Communication**: Explaining technical concepts to people with varying levels of expertise is essential in both environments, requiring patience and an ability to adjust explanations to the audience.

- **Reliability**: Both construction projects and school environments depend on systems working when they're needed, making preventative maintenance and quick responses to issues equally important.

My experience as a Site Supervisor taught me to manage complex systems while supporting diverse teams‚Äîskills directly applicable to maintaining your IT suites, classroom technology, and 1:1 iPad program. I've become adept at translating between technical and non-technical language, which would be valuable when supporting teachers and students with varying levels of comfort with technology.

My current training with CodeYourFuture has supplemented my practical problem-solving experience with more formal IT knowledge, including hardware troubleshooting, basic networking, and support best practices. I'm particularly interested in applying these skills in an educational environment where technology can significantly enhance learning experiences when properly supported.

The term-time only schedule appeals to me as it would provide an excellent work-life balance while allowing me to focus fully on supporting the school during the academic year. I'm comfortable with the requirement for an enhanced DBS check and understand the importance of appropriate conduct in an educational setting.

I live locally in Leeds, making me readily available to respond quickly to urgent technical issues. I am reliable, punctual, and pride myself on maintaining systems proactively to prevent problems before they affect users.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my practical experience and technical skills could benefit St. Margaret's Academy. I am available for an interview at your convenience.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Lee Thompson
