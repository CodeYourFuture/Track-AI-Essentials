## Personal Statement

I've spent nearly a decade helping hotels run smoothly, from Damascus to Birmingham. Along the way, I discovered something fascinating: behind every successful operation are the systems that make it tick. After streamlining operations for 45+ staff and implementing technology that saved over ¬£200,000 annually, I've turned my obsession with making technology work for people into a career in building better business solutions.
