# Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the Junior Infrastructure Engineer position at CloudScale UK. While my background is in programme management and community engagement, I believe my extensive experience in implementing data protection systems and managing technical infrastructure for community organisations makes me a strong candidate for this role.

In my current role at CodeYourFuture, I have developed and maintained data collection frameworks that serve over 20 partner organisations. This work has given me practical experience in system monitoring, backup procedures, and security protocol implementation‚Äîall key requirements for your position. I have also gained valuable experience in Linux systems through managing our organisation's digital infrastructure.

My programme management background has equipped me with strong problem-solving abilities and exceptional attention to detail, skills that I understand are crucial for infrastructure engineering. While I may not have traditional software engineering experience, I bring a unique perspective on system security and data protection, having implemented GDPR-compliant systems across multiple organisations.

I am particularly drawn to CloudScale UK's emphasis on professional development and certification support. I am committed to expanding my technical knowledge and would be eager to pursue AWS certification to enhance my contribution to your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my experience in system implementation and data protection could benefit CloudScale UK.

Yours sincerely,
Maryam Al-Fadhli
