# Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Junior Infrastructure Engineer position at CloudScale UK. As a former healthcare professional transitioning into technology through CodeYourFuture's software development programme, I bring a unique combination of technical aptitude and proven experience in high-pressure, detail-oriented environments.

Your requirement for strong problem-solving abilities and attention to detail particularly resonates with my background in healthcare, where these skills were essential for patient safety. My experience implementing and maintaining electronic healthcare systems has given me a solid foundation in system monitoring and maintenance, which I believe will transfer well to cloud infrastructure management.

Through my training at CodeYourFuture, I have gained practical experience with AWS services, including EC2 and S3, and have developed a strong understanding of Linux systems. My healthcare background has instilled in me a deep appreciation for robust backup and recovery processes, as well as the critical importance of maintaining security protocols‚Äîboth key responsibilities in this role.

I am particularly drawn to CloudScale UK's commitment to professional development through certification support. I am currently enhancing my cloud platform knowledge through self-study and would be eager to pursue formal AWS certification with your support.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my combination of healthcare precision and emerging technical skills could contribute to CloudScale UK's infrastructure team.

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,
Fatima Hussain
