# Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Junior Infrastructure Engineer position at CloudScale UK. My background combines practical infrastructure management from the construction industry with emerging expertise in cloud technologies and automation, making me well-suited for this role.

Your requirement for cloud platform knowledge aligns perfectly with my AWS Cloud Practitioner certification and hands-on experience managing AWS services through Terraform. The position's focus on system monitoring resonates with my recent work implementing Prometheus and Grafana solutions at CodeYourFuture, where I helped achieve a 40% reduction in system downtime.

My twelve years in construction have given me a unique perspective on infrastructure management. The skills I developed managing complex physical infrastructure projects transfer remarkably well to cloud infrastructure: attention to detail, systematic problem-solving, and the ability to coordinate multiple interconnected systems while maintaining high safety and reliability standards.

I am particularly drawn to CloudScale UK's emphasis on professional development. Having already obtained my AWS Cloud Practitioner certification, I am eager to pursue advanced AWS certifications and continue developing my infrastructure engineering expertise.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my combination of practical infrastructure experience and cloud technology skills could benefit your team.

Kind regards,
Lee Thompson
