Dear Hiring Manager,

**Application for Junior Functional Consultant ‚Äì BusinessTech Solutions**

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Junior Functional Consultant position at BusinessTech Solutions. With a First Class Honours degree in Computer Science from the University of Nigeria and a Master's from the University of Leicester, I am eager to transition my academic knowledge and emerging technical skills into a dynamic consulting role.

My background in software testing and quality assurance, combined with my training at CodeYourFuture, has equipped me with key skills that align perfectly with the requirements of this role. My experience in gathering requirements, developing test documentation, and working in agile environments demonstrates my ability to quickly adapt to the structured consulting approach at BusinessTech Solutions.

The role's emphasis on learning core software products and implementing enterprise solutions resonates deeply with my career aspirations. My Master's dissertation on "Automated Testing Strategies in Distributed Systems" showcases my analytical approach to technology, while my ongoing ISTQB certification reflects my commitment to professional development.

I am particularly drawn to BusinessTech Solutions' structured development program and the opportunity to work across various industries. My multilingual background, technical skills, and passion for technology make me an ideal candidate to contribute to your consulting team.

I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and enthusiasm can contribute to BusinessTech Solutions.

Yours sincerely,
Blessing Okonjo Peters
