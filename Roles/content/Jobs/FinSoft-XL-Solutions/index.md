## Team Backstory: Our Application Support Team

### Just for you as the interviewer

We're a small, friendly team that's been through some changes lately. Right now we have:

- One senior analyst who works part-time (3 days a week)
- Two junior analysts who started 6 months ago and are still learning

We need to hire 2-3 new people because:

1. We've just won a big contract with a new client
2. We're rolling out a major upgrade to our trading platform
3. Our team lead is on medical leave

Last year, we had a problem with two team members who couldn't work well together. One of them knew a lot about SQL and databases, but he would make complex changes without telling anyone or writing anything down. When there were problems, nobody else could fix them. This created a lot of stress, especially when clients were waiting for help. Both of these people eventually left.

We learned from this experience. Now, our team shares knowledge regularly and everyone must document their work. Our team atmosphere is much better now - we help each other and make sure everyone understands what's happening.

For these new positions, we care most about:

- People who can work well with others and share what they know
- Good communication skills, especially explaining technical things clearly
- Willingness to document work properly
- Patience when helping non-technical clients

We don't expect candidates to know everything about finance or have perfect SQL skills - we can teach these things. What we can't teach is a good attitude toward teamwork and communication.

This is a great opportunity for someone to join a positive team and grow their skills while working on interesting projects.
