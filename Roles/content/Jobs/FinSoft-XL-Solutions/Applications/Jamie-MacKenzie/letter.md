Hiring Manager  
FinSoft XL Solutions  
Edinburgh

## Re: Application Support Analyst Position

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the Application Support Analyst position at FinSoft XL Solutions. With my background in manufacturing systems and developing technical skills, I believe I can bring a valuable perspective to your application support team.

While my experience comes from the manufacturing sector rather than financial services, the core skills I've developed are directly transferable to application support:

- **System Monitoring**: Continuous oversight of critical production systems to identify issues before they impact operations
- **Troubleshooting Methodology**: Systematic approach to diagnosing and resolving complex technical problems
- **User Support**: Training and assisting staff with varying levels of technical expertise
- **Documentation**: Creating clear technical procedures and issue resolution guides
- **Process Optimization**: Identifying opportunities to improve system efficiency and reliability

During my time as a Production Line Supervisor at McVitie's Factory in Glasgow, I was responsible for both the technical systems and the people using them‚Äîa combination that mirrors the dual technical and customer service aspects of application support. I've learned to balance the technical requirements of system maintenance with the human elements of user assistance and training.

My current training with CodeYourFuture has supplemented my practical experience with more formal technical knowledge, including:

- SQL for database querying and reporting
- Python for automation and scripting
- Monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana
- Cloud infrastructure concepts and management

I understand that the financial trading applications supported by FinSoft XL Solutions operate in a different domain than manufacturing systems, but both environments share fundamental requirements for reliability, performance monitoring, and responsive support. My experience troubleshooting issues in time-sensitive production environments has taught me to prioritize effectively and communicate clearly under pressure‚Äîskills that would transfer well to supporting critical trading applications.

As a Glasgow resident, I am prepared to commute to Edinburgh for this opportunity. The benefits offered, particularly the flexible working hours, would support this arrangement effectively.

What attracts me to this role is the opportunity to apply my systematic problem-solving approach in a new technical domain while building on my experience supporting users through complex technical challenges. I am excited about the prospect of learning the specifics of financial trading applications and contributing to your support team's success.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background and technical skills could benefit FinSoft XL Solutions.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Jamie MacKenzie
