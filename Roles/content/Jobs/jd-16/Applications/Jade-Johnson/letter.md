Dear DigitalCraft Agency,

I am writing to apply for the Junior UI Designer position. My background in healthcare systems has given me valuable experience in user interface design from a practical perspective.

Through my work in healthcare, I have:

- Implemented digital systems used by 30+ staff members
- Created user documentation for complex healthcare applications
- Trained diverse user groups on new interfaces
- Identified and resolved usability issues
- Improved system adoption rates by 85%

At Meadowbrook Care Home, I:

- Led the implementation of new patient tracking software
- Designed simplified interfaces for daily care documentation
- Reduced training time for new systems by 50%
- Created user-friendly documentation

Currently at CodeYourFuture, I am developing:

- UI design skills with Figma
- Understanding of design principles
- Knowledge of responsive layouts
- Visual documentation methods

Your focus on user-centered design aligns with my experience making complex systems accessible to diverse users. I am particularly interested in:

- Applying my user experience insights
- Learning formal design principles
- Contributing to meaningful projects
- Growing in a creative environment

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my practical system experience could benefit your design team.

Best regards,
Jade Johnson
