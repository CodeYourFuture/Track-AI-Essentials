Dear DigitalCraft Agency,

I am writing to apply for the Junior UI Designer position. My background in custom furniture design provides a strong foundation in visual composition, attention to detail, and client communication that transfers effectively to digital design.

My experience includes:

- Creating detailed technical drawings for 200+ custom projects
- Managing visual documentation and design specifications
- Implementing consistent design standards
- Communicating complex design concepts to clients
- Leading design review sessions

Through my work at Sheffield Custom Furniture, I developed:

- Strong visual composition skills
- Precise attention to detail
- Clear documentation methods
- Effective client communication
- Quality control procedures

Currently at CodeYourFuture, I am building digital design skills:

- Learning UI design principles
- Developing Figma expertise
- Creating responsive layouts
- Understanding design systems
- Implementing visual components

Your collaborative environment and focus on learning match my approach to professional development. I am particularly interested in:

- Contributing my visual design experience
- Learning from your senior designers
- Developing UI expertise
- Participating in design reviews

My portfolio (mohammedalsayed.design) demonstrates my transition from physical to digital design, showing how my experience with proportion, visual balance, and attention to detail applies to user interface design.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my design background and developing digital skills could benefit your creative team.

Best regards,
Mohammed Al-Sayed
