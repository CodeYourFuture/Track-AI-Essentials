Hiring Manager  
Ping DataCenter Operations  
Reading

## Re: Infrastructure Support Technician Position

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the Infrastructure Support Technician position at Ping DataCenter Operations. As a recent Computer Science graduate with developing expertise in Linux systems and infrastructure automation, I am eager to contribute to your datacenter team.

Through my Computer Science degree and subsequent technical training with CodeYourFuture, I have developed skills directly relevant to this role:

- **Linux Systems**: Practical experience with Ubuntu and CentOS administration
- **Server Management**: Configuration and maintenance of server environments
- **Automation**: Python and Bash scripting for system maintenance tasks
- **Networking**: Understanding of basic routing, switching, and troubleshooting
- **Documentation**: Creation of clear technical procedures and configurations
- **Monitoring**: Implementation of system performance tracking tools

While I am early in my professional IT career, I have demonstrated my commitment to infrastructure management through my home lab projects and focused technical development. I've deliberately structured my learning to include hands-on experience with virtualized server environments, networking concepts, and system automation‚Äîall skills that would transfer directly to datacenter operations.

What particularly attracts me to this position is the opportunity to work with critical infrastructure in a 24/7 operational environment. I understand the importance of reliability, careful change management, and systematic troubleshooting in maintaining essential services. The hands-on nature of the role appeals to my preference for practical work, and I am comfortable with the physical aspects of datacenter operations, including equipment handling and installation.

I am particularly excited about the professional development benefits offered, especially datacenter certifications. These align perfectly with my career goals in infrastructure management and would support my continued growth in the field.

While I am currently based in London, I am prepared to relocate to Reading or commute for this position. The shift-based schedule is something I can adapt to, and I understand the importance of consistent coverage for critical systems.

I am eager to bring my enthusiasm for technology infrastructure, systematic approach to problem-solving, and commitment to continuous learning to your team. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my technical skills could benefit Ping DataCenter Operations.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Rahima Hassan
