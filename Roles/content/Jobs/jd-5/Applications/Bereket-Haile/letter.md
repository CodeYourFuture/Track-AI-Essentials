# Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Service Desk Support Specialist position at EduTech Solutions. My background in quality control at NHS Medical Supplies, combined with my current software engineering training, makes me particularly well-suited to deliver high-quality technical support in educational settings.

Your emphasis on maintaining support documentation and guiding users through technical solutions aligns perfectly with my experience. In my role at NHS Medical Supplies, I developed comprehensive documentation systems and trained dozens of staff members on complex procedures. These skills have proven invaluable in my current role at CodeYourFuture, where I have achieved a 98% issue resolution rate through systematic documentation and clear communication protocols.

I am particularly drawn to the educational focus of EduTech Solutions. The requirement to explain technical concepts simply matches my experience in creating accessible documentation and training materials. I understand the importance of maintaining clear communication channels and ensuring consistent service quality in educational environments.

Your commitment to professional development through the cycle to work scheme and training opportunities is particularly appealing. I am eager to continue developing my technical support capabilities while contributing to the success of educational institutions across Scotland.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background in quality assurance and technical documentation could benefit your support team.

Kind regards,
Bereket Haile
