# Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Service Desk Support Specialist position at EduTech Solutions. My background in youth digital education, combined with my current service desk training, makes me particularly well-suited to provide technical support in educational environments.

Your emphasis on patient guidance and clear communication aligns perfectly with my experience delivering digital skills training to young people at Glasgow Youth Impact. Having supported hundreds of users with varying technical abilities, I understand the importance of providing clear, empathetic technical assistance while maintaining professional standards.

Through my current training at CodeYourFuture, I have developed strong service desk capabilities while maintaining my focus on user support. I have successfully managed over 150 support tickets with a 97% satisfaction rate, while creating documentation that reduced resolution times by 35%.

I am particularly drawn to EduTech Solutions' focus on supporting educational institutions. Having worked extensively in youth education and digital inclusion, I understand the unique technical support needs of educational environments and the importance of maintaining clear communication channels with diverse user groups.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my combination of educational experience and technical expertise could benefit your support team.

Kind regards,
David Osei
