# Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the Service Desk Support Specialist position at EduTech Solutions. My extensive background in manufacturing systems support, combined with my current technical training, makes me well-qualified to provide effective IT support in educational settings.

Your requirement for strong problem-solving abilities and clear communication aligns perfectly with my experience supervising production systems at McVitie's. Having managed technical support for a 20-person production team and implemented digital tracking systems that improved efficiency by 30%, I understand the importance of both technical expertise and clear user guidance.

Through my current training at CodeYourFuture, I have expanded my technical capabilities while maintaining my focus on practical problem-solving and clear documentation. I have successfully provided technical support for industrial monitoring systems while creating comprehensive guides that reduced common support requests by 45%.

I am particularly drawn to EduTech Solutions' commitment to professional development. Having successfully managed my own transition from manufacturing to technology, I understand the value of continuous learning and would be eager to grow with your organization while supporting educational institutions across Scotland.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my combination of industrial systems experience and emerging technical expertise could benefit your support team.

Kind regards,
Jamie MacKenzie
