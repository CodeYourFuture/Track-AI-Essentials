Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the Junior Infrastructure Engineer position at CloudScale UK. I saw your job posting and got really excited about the opportunity to move into cloud infrastructure work. While my background is in retail systems, I believe my experience with databases and system monitoring would help me transition into this role.

In my current position at Leeds Shopping Centre, I work with customer databases and ensure our systems run smoothly. I handle things like monitoring system performance and helping with maintenance, which I think is similar to what you're looking for. I've also started learning about AWS through online courses and am studying for the Cloud Practitioner certification.

I know I don't have all the technical skills you're looking for yet, but I'm a fast learner and really passionate about moving into cloud infrastructure. My experience with data protection and security procedures would be helpful for maintaining security protocols, which I saw was one of the job responsibilities.

I would be really grateful for the opportunity to join CloudScale UK and learn more about cloud infrastructure. I'm excited about the training opportunities you offer and would work hard to get up to speed quickly.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Amy Wong
