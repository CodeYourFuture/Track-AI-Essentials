London

## Re: IT Field Engineer Position

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the IT Field Engineer position at Retail-IT. With my background in mobile technology, route optimization, and technical troubleshooting, I believe I can make a valuable contribution to your team supporting retail clients across the South East.

While my professional background as a delivery driver might not seem immediately relevant to IT support, the modern delivery environment is heavily technology-dependent and has equipped me with practical skills directly applicable to field engineering:

- **Mobile Device Support**: Daily troubleshooting of smartphones, tablets, and GPS devices in challenging field conditions
- **System Connectivity**: Resolving network and connection issues across diverse environments
- **Customer Interface**: Clear communication with customers while representing a brand
- **Route Planning**: Optimal navigation between locations for efficient service delivery
- **Problem-solving Under Pressure**: Quick resolution of technical issues with minimal downtime

During my time with Amazon Flex and Deliveroo, I took initiative to develop technical solutions, creating Python scripts to optimize delivery routes and building a basic tracking system for personal deliveries. This demonstrates both my technical aptitude and my drive to improve operational efficiency‚Äîskills that would transfer well to supporting retail IT systems.

My current training with CodeYourFuture has further developed my technical capabilities, particularly in areas such as hardware troubleshooting, networking fundamentals, and structured documentation. I've gained hands-on experience with system installation, configuration, and maintenance that would be directly applicable to the IT Field Engineer role.

As a London resident with a clean driving license, I am well-positioned to travel to retail locations throughout the South East. I am comfortable with the flexible nature of the zero-hours contract and understand the importance of being available for emergency call-outs when retail clients face urgent technical issues.

What particularly attracts me to this role is the variety of technical challenges and environments. I thrive when facing diverse problems that require adaptable solutions, and I enjoy the independence and responsibility that comes with field engineering work.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my unique background and technical skills could benefit Retail-IT and your clients. I am available for an interview at your convenience.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Mohammed Ibrahim
