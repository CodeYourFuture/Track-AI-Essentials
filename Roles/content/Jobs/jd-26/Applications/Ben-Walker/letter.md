Hiring Manager  
Retail-IT  
London

## Re: IT Field Engineer Position

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the IT Field Engineer position at Retail-IT. As an IT support professional based in Reading with a passion for hands-on technical work, I am excited about the opportunity to provide field support to retail clients throughout the South East.

While I am early in my professional IT career, I have developed substantial practical skills through my home lab environment, community tech support, and formal IT training. These experiences have equipped me with capabilities directly relevant to the IT Field Engineer role:

- **Hardware Support**: Extensive experience assembling, configuring, and troubleshooting PC hardware through my home lab projects
- **Network Installation**: Practical knowledge of cabling, router/switch configuration, and Wi-Fi setup
- **Problem-solving**: Methodical approach to identifying and resolving technical issues
- **Documentation**: Creation of clear technical procedures and issue tracking
- **Customer Support**: Experience explaining technical concepts to non-technical users through my volunteer work at the local library

I am particularly interested in the variety of technical challenges that come with supporting different retail environments. The opportunity to work with diverse systems including POS terminals, network infrastructure, CCTV, and digital signage aligns perfectly with my interest in broad technical exposure.

As a Reading resident with a clean driving license, I am well-positioned to travel throughout the South East to support your retail clients. I understand the importance of responsiveness in retail environments, where technical issues directly impact business operations, and am comfortable with the requirement for emergency call-out support.

The flexible nature of the zero-hours contract suits my current situation as I continue to develop my technical skills. I am physically fit and comfortable with the lifting requirements that come with equipment installation and maintenance.

What particularly attracts me to Retail-IT is the opportunity to gain diverse field experience across multiple retail environments. This position would allow me to apply my theoretical knowledge and home lab experience to real-world business challenges while developing specialized expertise in retail technology.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my technical skills and enthusiasm for hands-on support could benefit your team. I am available for an interview at your convenience.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Ben Walker
