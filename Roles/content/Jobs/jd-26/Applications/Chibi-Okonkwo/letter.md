## Re: IT Field Engineer Position

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the IT Field Engineer position at Retail-IT. With my background in security systems management and technical support in retail environments, I believe I am well-suited to help maintain IT equipment and resolve issues across your client retail chains.

During my five years as a Security Supervisor at Securitas UK, I gained extensive experience working with technical systems in retail environments. My responsibilities included:

- **Installing and maintaining CCTV systems** across multiple retail locations, ensuring proper configuration and operation
- **Managing access control systems** for retail staff, troubleshooting issues and maintaining databases
- **Providing technical support** to retail employees for security equipment and basic IT issues
- **Creating detailed documentation** for site surveys and equipment inventory
- **Responding to emergency situations** requiring quick thinking and effective problem-solving

This experience has given me a solid understanding of retail operations and the critical importance of functioning technical systems to business continuity. I'm comfortable working in diverse retail environments and have developed strong customer service skills through regular interaction with store staff.

My current training in software engineering has further developed my technical capabilities, particularly in areas such as networking, system configuration, and troubleshooting methodologies. I've gained hands-on experience with hardware installation, cable management, and system maintenance that would be directly applicable to the IT Field Engineer role.

I hold a clean UK driving license and am comfortable with regular travel to different locations. As a London resident, I'm well-positioned to serve retail clients throughout the South East. I'm physically fit and accustomed to lifting equipment during installations and maintenance work.

What particularly appeals to me about this position is the opportunity to combine my technical skills with my experience in retail environments. The variety of visiting different locations and tackling diverse technical challenges suits my problem-solving mindset and preference for active, hands-on work.

I am comfortable with the flexible nature of the zero-hours contract and understand the need for emergency call-out support in retail IT operations. My background in security has prepared me well for responding to urgent situations outside standard hours.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience and skills could benefit Retail-IT and your clients. I am available for an interview at your convenience.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Chibi Okonkwo
