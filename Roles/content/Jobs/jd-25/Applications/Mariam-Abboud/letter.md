Hiring Manager  
FinSoft XL Solutions  
Edinburgh

## Re: Application Support Analyst Position

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the Application Support Analyst position at FinSoft XL Solutions. With my background in laboratory information systems and developing software engineering skills, I believe I can bring valuable technical expertise to your application support team.

During my six years as a Medical Laboratory Technician at Beirut General Hospital, I gained extensive experience maintaining critical systems where accuracy and reliability were paramount‚Äîqualities equally important in financial trading applications. My responsibilities included:

- **System Monitoring**: Ensuring laboratory information systems operated efficiently and accurately
- **User Support**: Assisting medical staff with technical issues and application usage
- **Data Management**: Maintaining data integrity across interconnected systems
- **Process Automation**: Developing scripts to streamline laboratory workflows
- **Documentation**: Creating comprehensive guides and standard operating procedures

Working in a medical environment taught me to approach technical problems with both urgency and precision‚Äîwhen patient results were at stake, effective and accurate resolution was essential. This experience developed my ability to remain composed under pressure and maintain meticulous attention to detail, skills directly transferable to supporting financial applications where similar standards apply.

My current training with CodeYourFuture has enhanced my technical foundation, particularly in areas relevant to application support:

- SQL for database querying and data analysis
- Java and Spring Boot for understanding application architecture
- Automated testing methodologies for systematic troubleshooting
- AWS and infrastructure concepts for system environment comprehension

The healthcare and financial sectors share several fundamental requirements: data security, system reliability, regulatory compliance, and the need for clear communication between technical and non-technical stakeholders. My experience bridging the gap between laboratory technicians, medical staff, and IT teams has prepared me well for the liaison role between users, developers, and other stakeholders in application support.

As a Glasgow resident, I am prepared to commute to Edinburgh for this position. The benefits offered, particularly the flexible working hours, would support this arrangement effectively.

What attracts me to FinSoft XL Solutions is the opportunity to apply my technical skills and methodical approach in a new sector while building on my experience supporting critical systems. I am eager to learn the specifics of financial trading applications and contribute my problem-solving abilities to your support team.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my unique background and technical skills could benefit your organization.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Mariam Abboud
