Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the Mid-Level Developer position at TechStack Solutions. My background combines extensive systems engineering experience with modern software development skills, making me a strong candidate for this role.

My technical experience includes:

- Programming in multiple languages (Java, Python, C++)
- Managing cloud infrastructure using AWS
- Leading development teams
- Supporting production systems
- Implementing machine learning solutions

At Iran Khodro, I managed complex technical systems and led a team of engineers, demonstrating my ability to handle multiple responsibilities effectively. My experience includes:

- Developing diagnostic software systems
- Managing 24/7 system operations
- Leading technical teams
- Creating automated testing frameworks

Currently at CodeYourFuture, I am expanding my software development skills through:

- Full-stack application development
- Cloud infrastructure management
- Container orchestration
- Automated testing implementation

My experience level does not fully match your requirements; I am committed to rapid skill development and can contribute immediately in multiple areas. I am particularly interested in your startup environment and the opportunity to work across different technical domains.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my technical background and leadership experience could benefit TechStack Solutions.

Best regards,
Reza Ahmadi
