## Re: Desktop Support Engineer Position

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the Desktop Support Engineer position at Corporate Systems Ltd. With my background in mathematics education and technical support, I believe I can bring valuable analytical and communication skills to your team supporting legal professionals.

My experience as a Mathematics Teacher and Desktop Support Volunteer has equipped me with several skills directly transferable to professional IT support:

- **User Support**: Providing patient, clear assistance to users with varying levels of technical proficiency
- **Systematic Problem-solving**: Applying analytical thinking to identify and resolve complex issues
- **Technical Training**: Developing and delivering effective instruction on software applications
- **Documentation**: Creating clear guides and procedures for consistent system management
- **Hardware Troubleshooting**: Diagnosing and resolving equipment issues efficiently

During my time as a Mathematics Teacher, I often served as the technical point person for my department, supporting colleagues with software applications, digital assessment systems, and hardware issues. This unofficial IT support role developed my ability to balance technical problem-solving with clear communication‚Äîa skill combination that would be valuable when supporting legal professionals who need both effective solutions and understandable explanations.

My volunteer work at Manchester Community Tech Hub has given me practical experience in Windows desktop support, including software deployment, user account management, and hardware maintenance. This hands-on experience, combined with my current training at CodeYourFuture, has built my technical knowledge in areas directly relevant to this position:

- Windows workstation configuration and troubleshooting
- Active Directory user and group management
- Remote access setup and support
- Hardware diagnostics and replacement
- Mobile device configuration and management

As a Manchester resident, I am very familiar with the local area and can easily reach your office and client locations. I have a clean driving license and am comfortable with site visits to support users at different locations.

What particularly attracts me to Corporate Systems Ltd is your focus on supporting legal firms, which presents an opportunity to apply my skills in a professional environment where clear communication and reliable technical support are essential. I understand the importance of minimizing disruption to legal professionals' work and would approach support with both technical precision and service efficiency.

The professional development benefits offered, particularly certification support, align with my commitment to continuous learning in the IT field. I am especially interested in pursuing Microsoft certifications to enhance my technical capabilities.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background and technical skills could benefit your desktop support team.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Haile Tekle
