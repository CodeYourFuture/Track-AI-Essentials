Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my concern regarding the Mid-Level Developer position at TechStack Solutions. After reviewing the requirements, I observe several potential issues that should be addressed:

The job posting requires expertise in multiple programming languages and responsibilities that would typically be distributed across several roles. This includes:

- Frontend and backend development
- Cloud infrastructure management
- Customer support
- Team leadership

The requirement for 10+ years of experience with modern frameworks appears inconsistent, as many current frameworks have not existed for that duration.

Additionally, the expectation to handle multiple programming languages at an expert level while maintaining on-call availability may lead to reduced code quality and potential burnout.

I recommend restructuring this position into more focused roles with realistic requirements. This would help attract qualified candidates and ensure sustainable work practices.

While I am not applying for this position, I would be interested in discussing quality assurance opportunities that match my background in systematic testing and documentation.

Thank you for considering this feedback.

Best regards,
Priya Patel
