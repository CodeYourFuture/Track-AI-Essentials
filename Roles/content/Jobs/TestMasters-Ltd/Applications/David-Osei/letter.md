Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the Automation Test Engineer position at TestMasters Ltd. My experience in technical support and system testing provides relevant skills for this role.

Through my current position at CodeYourFuture, I have developed testing capabilities:

- Creating automated test procedures
- Implementing quality assurance processes
- Maintaining detailed technical documentation
- Validating system functionality

My background in support and training offers additional relevant experience:

- Systematic approach to testing
- Clear technical communication
- Process documentation
- Quality validation

Your requirements for analytical thinking and documentation skills match my current capabilities. While I am developing my programming expertise, I bring strong experience in systematic testing and quality assurance.

The position at TestMasters Ltd would allow me to expand my testing skills while applying my documentation and quality assurance experience. I am particularly interested in your focus on test automation and process improvement.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my technical background could support your testing team.

Yours sincerely,
David Osei
